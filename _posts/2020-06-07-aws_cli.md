## AWS, CLI, and AWS S3:
*Objective of this post is to make acquaintance with AWS s3 services and how to access it and manage it with CLI from Command line*


### Lets get these key terms explained for once and for all:

**What is AWS?**
Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

**What is AWS S3?**
Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its global e-commerce network.

**What is AWS CLI?**
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.


### Steps to making best use of CLI:
- Lets make 2 buckets
- Upload some files
- Copy file from one bucket to another
- Download some files from these buckets
- Sync them with a local folder
- Make a presign
- Delete these buckets

```
    C:\Users\shrey>aws configure

    AWS Access Key ID [****************TM36]: ****2O
    AWS Secret Access Key [****************tmuq]: /*************1
    Default region name [us-east-1]: us-east-1
    Default output format [JSON]: JSON
```
**Lets make 2 buckets:**

```
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 mb s3://sjk714
    make_bucket: sjk714

    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 mb s3://sjk714a
    make_bucket: sjk714a
```

**Lets copy some files to the bucket sjk714:**
- Remember the first location is always the Source and second location is Destination

```
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 cp C:\Users\shrey\OneDrive\Desktop\s3\sjk.txt s3://sjk714
    upload: OneDrive\Desktop\s3\sjk.txt to s3://sjk714/sjk.txt
```

**Lets copy the uploaded file in sjk714 bucket to sjk714a bucket:**

```
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 cp s3://sjk714/sjk.txt s3://sjk714a
    copy: s3://sjk714/sjk.txt to s3://sjk714a/sjk.txt
```

**Lets move file from sjk714 bucket to local drive:**
- Remember moving file will remove it from source location and move it to destination

```
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 mv s3://sjk714/sjk.txt C:\Users\shrey\OneDrive\Desktop\s3
    move: s3://sjk714/sjk.txt to OneDrive\Desktop\s3\sjk.txt
```
You will notice that the file from sjk714 bucket was removed with the above line.

**Lets use sync to sync files from my local destination to sjk714 bucket:**
- First we will list down the files in s3 bucket.
- Next we will sync
- Now we will again check the files in s3 bucket.

```
    # sjk714 bucket is empty
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 ls s3://sjk714

    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 ls s3://sjk714a
    2020-06-07 17:28:28         13 sjk.txt

    C:\Users\shrey>:: we can see that sjk714 is empty
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 sync C:\Users\shrey\OneDrive\Desktop\s3 s3://sjk714
    upload: OneDrive\Desktop\s3\sjk.txt to s3://sjk714/sjk.txt
    upload: OneDrive\Desktop\s3\sjk1.txt to s3://sjk714/sjk1.txt
    upload: OneDrive\Desktop\s3\sjk2.txt to s3://sjk714/sjk2.txt
    upload: OneDrive\Desktop\s3\down\sjk2.txt to s3://sjk714/down/sjk2.txt

    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 ls s3://sjk714
                               PRE down/
    2020-06-07 17:36:56         13 sjk.txt
    2020-06-07 17:36:56         12 sjk1.txt
    2020-06-07 17:36:56         14 sjk2.txt

    # all the files from local destination were moved to the bucket
```
**The cool thing about sync function:**
- If you delete some files from the s3 bucket and sync again with the local destination it will only upload the deleted files.
- If the files were deleted from the source destination, AWS won't delete files from bucket without `--delete` extension.

To try the second point I will do a simple experiment for you:
- I will delete sjk.txt file from the local Destination
- Try to sync the bucket without `--delete` extension
- Later, I will try to sync with the extension.

    C:\Users\shrey>:: Lets try to sync the sjk714 bucket
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 sync C:\Users\shrey\OneDrive\Desktop\s3 s3://sjk714

    C:\Users\shrey>:: It did not delete the file from s3 bucket. Lets try the same with --delete extension
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 sync C:\Users\shrey\OneDrive\Desktop\s3 s3://sjk714 --delete
    delete: s3://sjk714/sjk.txt
```

**Lets make a presign to access the file data in the Buckets:**
- It gives you a link that will show the content of your files.
- The `--expires-in 30` significe that the link will be valid for 30 seconds.

```
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 presign s3://sjk714/sjk.txt --expires-in 30
    https://sjk714.s3.amazonaws.com/sjk.txt?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAQU6F5LRCF2EAES2O&Signature=yQpayn1kBJqYo6BCW488AwwQnAQ%3D&Expires=1591566243
```
### Cleaning up post practice:
- Always remember to delete all the buckets to avoid any charges.
- You have to empty the bucket before you can delete it.

```
    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 rm s3://sjk714 --recursive
    delete: s3://sjk714/down/sjk2.txt
    delete: s3://sjk714/sjk1.txt
    delete: s3://sjk714/sjk.txt
    delete: s3://sjk714/sjk2.txt

    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 rm s3://sjk714a --recursive
    delete: s3://sjk714a/sjk.txt

    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 rb s3://sjk714a
    remove_bucket: sjk714a

    C:\Users\shrey>aws s3 rb s3://sjk714
    remove_bucket: sjk714
```
**I hope this post turned out helpful. Keep Learning and growing**
