## 1. B-Tech Electronics and Telecommunication from NMIMS Mumbai, India.
 *In four years of my B-tech I learned and grew in key technical areas such as:*
 -  Digital communication techniques
 -  Information theory
 -  Electronic design
 -  High-frequency techniques
 -  Core Java Programing
### Learning Curve:  
 - Developed and conducted appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
 - Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.
 - Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, meet objectives, using appropriate learning strategies.

 *Besides a solid math science/engineering education, I was exposed to application fields such as IoT, Embedded Systems, Networking, Communication, Control Systems, Microwave and Antenna, Basic Electronics and Signal & Image Processing.*

## 2. Masters of Science in Management of Technology from New York University, New York, USA.
*Soon after working fulltime for a year I realized a gap between my technical problem solving skills and Business growing inference.
To bridge this gap I decided to pursue my Masters and broaden my knowledge and skills in Data exploration, Data Inference and Business Growth strategy building*

*In two years of my Msc I learned and grew in key technical areas such as:*
- **Statistics for Data Analytics:** Exploring underlying mathematical foundation of descriptive statistics, probability, and hypothesis testing, also covered regression analysis and time series analysis with an emphasis on model formulation and interpretation of results.
- **Business Intelligence Analysis:** Concepts and best practices for corporate Dashboard reporting with use of BI tools like Advance excel, Power BI, Tableau and Alteryx.
- **Data Analytics with R and Python:** Solving business problem case with making use of available data and best practices in Descriptive, Predictive,  and Prescriptive analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Story telling with aesthetically pleasing Visualization and best practices to narrate a data story to varying audiences.
- **Data Mining:** Machine Learning concepts and practices used in large organizations to make the best use of growing data availability.
- **Data Engineering:** Theoretical and practical implementation of Database management and Graph Network theory with business cases in different domains ranging from economics and agriculture to stock market.
- **Corporate Finance and Accounting:** Advance concepts of Finance and Accounting with financial analysis and modelling on real world case studies dealing with merger and acquisitions and forecast value evaluation.
- **Industrial Economics and strategy:** Studied concepts and impacts of Macro & Micro economy, consumer behavior,  economic value creation , Value-based strategies etc.
